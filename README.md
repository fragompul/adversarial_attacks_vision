> **Unveiling the geometric and topological vulnerabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks through Adversarial Machine Learning.**

## 📖 Project Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved superhuman performance in image classification. However, they possess a critical and fascinating vulnerability: **Adversarial Examples**. By applying carefully crafted, imperceptible mathematical noise to an image using gradient descent, we can force a highly confident, yet completely incorrect prediction from the network.

**Origin & Evolution:**
This project originated as my **Bachelor's Thesis (TFG)** for the Double Major in Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Seville. Driven by the mathematical depth of the topic, I continuously expanded the codebase to include advanced topological research. Aspects of this ongoing research and related methodologies have been adapted for academic conferences.

Designed to bridge theoretical research and practical software engineering, this repository provides both the rigorous mathematical implementations of these attacks and a production-ready interactive dashboard to explore CNN vulnerabilities in real-time.

## ✨ Key Features & Research Areas

1. **State-of-the-Art Attack Implementations:** Clean, optimized TensorFlow algorithms for Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Carlini & Wagner (C&W), DeepFool, and Targeted I-FGSM.
2. **Quantitative Robustness Analytics:** Mass evaluation of models (MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3) tracking Attack Success Rate (ASR) vs perceptual distortion (L2 norm), alongside transferability heatmaps.
3. **Latent Space Topology:** Dimensionality reduction (PCA and t-SNE) mapping how adversarial vectors physically push data points across decision boundaries inside the network's hidden layers.
4. **Attractors & 3D Loss Landscapes:** Visualization of the complex non-convex loss surfaces, illustrating how gradient-based attacks navigate "mountains of error" and fall into adversarial sink classes.
5. **Interactive Web Dashboard:** A complete, object-oriented Streamlit application that wraps the mathematical engine, allowing users to upload images and hack neural networks live from their browser.
